## Running your Tests

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 18 or later installed. Then, in this directory, run:

```bash
npm install             # install dependencies
npx playwright install  # setup Playwright browsers
npm run test            # run your tests!
```

View the [Appetize documentation](https://docs.appetize.io/javascript-sdk/playwright) for more information.

## Configuration

You'll find the configuration for your Appetize tests in `playwright.config.ts`. This file contains configuration for both
Playwright and your Appetize sessions.

These will apply for all tests in your project, but you can override them in your test files with:

```ts
import { test } from "@appetize/playwright";

test.use({
  config: {
    /* some config */
  },
});
```

## Writing more tests

You can record more tests with AppRecorder on [appetize.io](https://appetize.io) and copy them here, or you can write
tests [manually](https://docs.appetize.io/javascript-sdk/automation).

Here's an example of automating a login flow for an Android app:

```ts
import { test } from "@appetize/playwright";

test("shows greeting when user logs in", async ({ session }) => {
  // type username
  await session.tap({
    element: {
      attributes: {
        "resource-id": "username_field",
      },
    },
  });
  await session.type("jordan_doe");

  // type password
  await session.tap({
    element: {
      attributes: {
        "resource-id": "password_field",
      },
    },
  });
  await session.type("securepassword");

  // tap login button
  await session.tap({
    element: {
      attributes: {
        text: "Login",
      },
    },
  });

  // expect to see the user's name on the screen
  await expect(session).toHaveElement({
    attributes: {
      text: "Welcome, Jordan Doe",
    },
  });
});
```
